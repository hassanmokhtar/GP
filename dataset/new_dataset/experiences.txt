data about patients it was built using couch database lite. on the other hand we propose this data for the

pharmaceutical companies through our analytic dash board which we built using Jboss to help them

improve their services and sales this analytic dash board has also its local database which was created

using couch database server and both databases (for mobile app and analytic dashboard) are

synchronized together using sync gateway. We followed the Agile method to achieve this project we

Awards

This is where you can highlight the fellowships, scholarships, or other honours and awards you have

received that are relevant to your discipline and the position that you are applying to. If the honour or award

will not be familiar to those who read your cv, it is acceptable to include a brief line below the honour or

award name that explains what the award is for or its primary criteria. The dollar value of the honour or

award may also be included in your cv and can be based on the amount, prestige of the award and level of

importance within your field. Finally, this section may also be place towards the end of your cv depending

on how relevant it is to the position you are applying to.



Research and Teaching Interests

This section typically follows the Honours & Awards section of the cv. Your teaching and/or research

interests should be reflective of your areas of expertise and those that you would like to pursue in the future.

Additionally, these interests should also be tailored to the position and department of the academic or

research institution you are applying to.




Experience

This category may be presented in varying ways: research experience; teaching experience; professional

experience; and academic administrative experience. It is important to note that the order of the sections

within the main experience section change depending on the focus on the position you are applying to.



• Research experience — For this section, list all research projects and/or research assistantships worked on

including your thesis, dissertation, any collaborative research in industry or with government and all post

doctoral fellowships. For each experience, include information on the institution, the supervisor of the

project, the research group, the subject, and your specific role.



• Teaching experience — List all relevant teaching experience, including instructorships, teaching

assistantships, or any experience as a marker. Include the course title, the department name and institution

name, your title, and the date for each experience. It is recommended that you indicate the level of each

course you are teaching, (i.e., undergraduate or graduate level course), and a brief description of your role,

such as holding tutorials, or conducting lectures, developing curriculum, holding office hours etc.



• Professional experience — If you have experience outside of academia, in a position relevant to your

discipline, then this should be included in the cv with a similar format of date, title, institution, and brief

description of your role. Including this information demonstrates your continued engagement with your

field and the diversity of your experience.



• Academic and administrative experience — Many faculty appointments involve some administrative and

committee work, and this section can demonstrate to a hiring committee that you will be able to fulfill any

commitments of this nature. It is very useful therefore to list any administrative experience you may have.

Committee work for your faculty — including participation on a hiring committee as a graduate student,

and membership on academic councils. Additionally, if you have done administrative work for any

association or have held positions within a graduate student union or graduate student committees or

government this experience can be listed in this section, since it demonstrates your engagement with your

discipline and your contribution to the wider academic community. Any editorships at journals can appear

here as well, along with conferences you helped organize. This section may also be referred to as

community involvement.
